            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Fresh Ingredients -</h4>The 2 key ingredients, i.e. Paneer and peas 
                    have to be fresh and moist. Homemade moist paneer is highly recommended
                    with fresh peas over frozen ones. Also, try to use flavored and fresh 
                    aromatic spices to get the best result.
                </li>
                <li><h4>Gravy Base -</h4>The ideal and authentic way to prepare the gravy
                    base is to make it with finely chopped tomatoes and onions. These are 
                    sauteed till mushy and then blended to a smooth paste. Avoid using canned 
                    tomato puree and canned white onions.
                </li>
                <li><h4>Cream vs. Yogurt -</h4>The texture and the creaminess of the gravy 
                    base arrive with the addition of dairy products like cream or curd (yogurt). 
                    However, the addition of cream makes it super tasty as yogurt can make it 
                    sour or tangy in taste.
                </li>
                <li><h4>Experiment -</h4>The recipe can be experimented with to have additional 
                    vegetables with the matar and paneer. However, it should not supersede the 
                    2 main ingredients. You may add sliced carrots, mushrooms, and even capsicums.
                </li>
                <li><h4>Simmer Slowly -</h4>The important tip to get the best flavor and taste 
                    is to cook the tomato onion gravy base in slow to medium heat. The oil should 
                    start oozing out which means the base is perfectly cooked and ready to take 
                    paneer and matar in it.
                </li>
